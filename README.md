Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

   - my Operating sytem I installed is window 10 for one machine and other window 11 , due to some programe require fetures of window 10 more than window 11
   - also window 11 for some machine  make it to operate difficult due to advanced feture of it doesnt match or correspond with machine

   - window 11
   window 11 installations require the preparation of the following
   USB flash driver
   setup file ( can be disk file or normal file)
   bootloder, for booting flash driver. example rufus, power iso, the victory ect.

   

   INSTALLATIONS

   -After boot flash( copy window file to usb flash), insert the usb flash with window file to a computer through USB port
   - BOOT OPTION is differenet from different computer it can be Esc+F2,F9,F10,F11,F12 it depend on the brand of the computer and keyboad of that computer
   - choose the disk for window installation ( it is adviced to customize window not upgaded it)
   - choose language, keyboad and other feature required for the installations after the file completed installed.
   - Initial setup like name, password it depend on the user.
   

   UPGRATION:

   upgrations of window 11 mostly is from window 10 that is updated full. it is easy to upgrade it from window 10 because no many step required just to upgrade it only.
   - upgration of window 11 from window 10 sometimes can couse a computer to jum every time and make it to road more sometimes ,so for my self not all machine require window 11 to install or upgrade although sometime machine can meet all the initail requirement for window 11  but machine can not function propely

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

   VISUAL STUDIO CODE ( VS CODE):
   This is the open source free code environment whwre by it allow to code diffent language on it such as java, c++, python, c programing and java script

   installation of VS code start from downloading it from the bowser>https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
   where by it allow you to choose what kind of file suitable for user machine ,example for window user, mac user and linux all setup is available
   carefull installations of virsual studio code it will allow you to code to edit and excute different language and file.
   check some steps for installation of VCcode
   - Run the Installer
   - Accept the License Agreement
   - choose the destination foler where you want to install VS code
   - check the required setup and additions fetures for installations of it 
   - click install to , the istallations beggin 
   - finish the installation    
    Finish and exist the Istallations

3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

   Installations of Git, as git bush and open up the github account... git is for the command wringting, initialize the project also used to link github and vs code ...git can be similar to CMD but git is more advanced and environment friendly than other.

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

  Python is the more powerfull language for the deveoper that can be installed in a machine and used in different place and part.
  python can be used or coded in git, vs code, pycham community all this a the environment were we can write a python code.
  - nstall an IDE like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or use a text editor like Sublime Text. 
  Configure the IDE to use your Python interpreter and virtual environmen


5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

   pip this is the python package used to install set up or package, uninstall setup, upgrade set up as well as list installed package.
   example pip used to install django as
   "python -m pip install django"
   and to uninstall it is "pip uninstall django"

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

   MySQL data base can be installed and downloaded from the site : https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html
   After down load it the foolowing steps used to install it ad being ready for use
   - Run the Installer:
   - Configure MySQL Server:
   - Complete Installation:
   - Open MySQL Workbench and create a new database
   - Activate Your Virtual Environment, in the installions of MySQL client for python





7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

My REPOSITORY LINK FOR DJANGO PROJECT AFTER CRETAING IT AND PUSH TO THE GITHUB AS 

REPOSITORY LINK : https://github.com/Leofansy/My-Django-First-project-with-python.git

CHALLENGE:

1. There are many challange faced during the installations especially django first project...to interesting that I misplaced the index/ with admin in urls my page send me to administrator login page.
2. To slow machine that make waiting for too long but the issue can be resolved.
